## Introduction
This project may be my first game. It is a project developed in C language as a console application when I do not know graphical user interface technologies. To summirize briefly, it is an RPG genre and a game for character development. The player's data is saved in a txt file. So the progress is not reset. You can play various fun mini-games in that game.

<br/>

## Technologies

* C Language

<br/>

## Features

* Game data not losing. Its saving txt file.
* There are many mini games you can play in that game.
* Even if is a console application, I think it is enjoyable.

## Poor Features

* There is no language option. It is by default Turkish.
